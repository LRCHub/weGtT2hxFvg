Why don't you spread your wings
And fly away
Little bird
Fly away
And if it's true love, it will always stay
Little bird fly away
He will never treat you
The way you want him to
Although I know he'll need you
Like I do

Fly high
Fly over the mountains fly
Fly my bird and say goodbye
Fly high
Fly over the rainbow fly
Fly my bird and say goodbye
Goodbye
